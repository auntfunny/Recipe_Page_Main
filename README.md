## Overview

  This project was to recreate a recipe page and make it as similar to the original page as possible. It also was a challenge for responsiveness to make the page work for mobile devices as well, using media queries or breakpoints to change the design according to the size of the device.

## My process

I started by building the HTML structure of the page, and then began to apply styles with Tailwind CSS to achieve the design that I needed. After making the desktop version look like the image, I added in the styles for the Mobile version, changing sizes of certain elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Tailwind
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  I used this project to practice new stlyes with Tailwind CSS, like desgining a table, and using spans to make certain parts of text different colors or fonts. I also practiced much more responsiveness to make my pages more accessible.

### Continued development

  I want to continue practicing with Tailwind to grow faster and more efficient, and to try desgining mobile first to cause less work for myself and be a more efficient programmer.
